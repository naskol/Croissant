    <p>
        A croissant is a type of pastry, classically made with puff pastry dough so that it is light, flaky, and
        extremely
        buttery. Traditionally, croissants are formed into crescent shapes, which is probably where the name originated,
        since
        croissant means ‚Äúcrescent‚Äù in French. The pastries are extremely popular in France as well as in other nations,
        and are
        typically eaten with breakfast. In some cases, croissants may also be filled with sweet or savory ingredient, or
        used
        like bread to make croissant sandwiches.
